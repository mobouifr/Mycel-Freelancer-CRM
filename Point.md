Modules
You will need to earn 14 points in total to complete your project. Each major module
is worth 2 points, and each minor module is worth 1 point.
The following categories are available. You may choose multiple modules from any category:
• Web
• Accessibility and Internationalization
• User Management
• Artificial Intelligence
• Cybersecurity
• Gaming and user experience
• Devops
• Data and Analytics
• Blockchain
• Modules of choice
We strongly recommend choosing modules only after your ideas are clear and you have
a good understanding of what you want to build.
Additionally, aiming for more than 14 points in total may be a good idea, especially if
some modules aren’t validated during the evaluation.

Important - Module Dependencies aluation:
• Some modules require other modules to be implemented first
(marked with info notes).
• Gaming modules (AI Opponent, Tournament, Game customization,
Spectator mode, Multiplayer 3+, Add another game) require that
at least one game be implemented first.
• The Game Statistics module requires that a game be implemented.
• Advanced chat features require the basic chat functionality
from the "User interaction" module.
• SSR is incompatible with the ICP blockchain backend.
• Plan your modules carefully to ensure they work together
coherently!
• During evaluation: You will be asked to demonstrate
each claimed module. Only fully functional and properly
implemented modules will be counted toward your final score.
Non-functional or incomplete modules = 0 points.
